## Simple parser of igblast results

[Igblast](https://github.com/ncbi/igblast) allows to view the matches to the germline V, D and J genes, details at rearrangement junctions and a lot more (see [documentation](https://ncbi.github.io/igblast/).  

The output includes a lot of information in a format that can't be directly used in statistical analyses.  

This simple script parses igblast output into a csv formatted table, easy to understand and ready to include in a statistical analysis.
